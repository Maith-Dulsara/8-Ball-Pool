#IMPLEMENTED RULES OF POOL

• Instead of balls of multiple colors, this game is played with only two colors, namely, Yellow 
and Orange (as in English Pool). 

• The Colors will be allocated to each player based on the color of the ball that is potted first. 
eg:- If Player 1 pots a red ball first, they will get Red (R) and player 2 will get Yellow(Y).

• Players should aim to pot all the balls of their respective color.
 For every ball potted, the player will get an additional chance to shoot. If a player pots a ball of 
the wrong color, the other player will get a point. Then no additional chances will be given. 

• If a player pots the Cue (white) ball, then the other player will be given the chance to place the 
cue ball at any location and shoot. This is the only instance the moving of the cue ball with the 
left mouse button is allowed. 

• To win, a player should pot all the balls of their respective color and pot the 8 (Grey) Ball.

• If a player pots the black ball before this, it will be an automatic defeat. So the other player 
will win.


#HOW TO PLAY

• Game starts with the breaking of the triangle with the cue ball and ends with the sinking of 
the 8-ball (Grey colored ball). 

• The first person (player 1) gets to break the triangle with the cue ball. This ball can be used 
only to strike other balls.

• The first player who sinks a colored ball will be allocated that color and should sink only the 
balls with that same respective color. 

• Player can decide the power and the angle of the cue ball.

• To do this, right-click on the cue ball and drag the mouse in to the opposite direction of the 
direction that you want to shoot. 

• Release the Right Mouse Button after deciding the angle to shoot the cue ball to the targeted 
colored ball.

• If required, the Player can cancel the shot by clicking left mouse button. 

• The Player can move the cue ball by clicking left mouse button on the ball and dragging it 
down. A player should move the cue ball in this way, ONLY if the other player sinks the cue 
ball during their turn.

• To score points, the players should sink the colored balls.

• If the player is able to sink the correct colored ball (Red/Yellow) the corresponding party 
will get another chance to shoot. If the player is unable to sink a colored ball, the other 
player gets a chance to shoot the cue ball.

• If a player sinks the cue ball instead a colored ball, other player will get the chance to shoot 
in the next turn. 

• The first player who sinks all the colored balls and the 8-ball wins the game. By any chance 
if a player sink the 8-ball before the other balls other player wins the match.
